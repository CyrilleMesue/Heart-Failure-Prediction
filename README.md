# Heart-Failure-Prediction
This project is an end to end machine learning project on the [heart failure prediction dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction) obtained from kaggle.

This project contains a complete notebook showing steps from data description, exploratory data analysis to machine learning modelling (achieved 90% accuracy). The project also contains a streamlit application that can be used for a more dynamic exploratory analysis. I have created dashboard with streamlit, and you can observe and make your own conclusions. 

### Usage
1. Clone the project repository  
    ```git clone https://github.com/CyrilleMesue/Heart-Failure-Prediction.git```
2. Install all dependencies. Make sure you are in the project directory in the terminal.   
    ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
4. To run streamlit app, type the following code on the terminal.    
    ```streamlit run edaapp.py```
